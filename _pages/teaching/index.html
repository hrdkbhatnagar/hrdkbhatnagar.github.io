The deep learning version of the course covers deep learning, including theory and techniques with an emphasis on neuroscience. With over 3000 students, these courses emphasized small group projects to apply the theory and techniques learned during the course.</p> <p>You can find more information about the courses, including course content and syllabus, on the <a href="https://academy.neuromatch.io/home" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Neuromatch Academy website</a>.</p> <p>Course content: <a href="https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Computational neuroscience</a>, <a href="https://deeplearning.neuromatch.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Deep learning</a></p> </body></html>
